1 teaspoon cumin powder
1/2 teaspoon garam masala powder
salt as required
1 teaspoon coriander leaves
2 tablespoon ghee
1 handful raw peanuts


Step 1 Prepare the masala for potato filling
To make delicious samosas at home. First, make the filling,
Put a pan on the heat and add 2 tsp oil
Once the oil is hot enough, add cumin seeds and allow them to crackle.

Step 2 Add spices and boiled potatoes and cook for a while,
Now add whole coriander seeds, ginger and green chilli.
Saute for a minute and then add chopped cashews and raisins, peanuts if you like them,
boiled and mashed potatoes, cumin,powder, coriander powder, garam masala powder, red chilli powder,
salt to taste, kasoori methi,coriander leaves. Mix well and saute for 2 minutes.


Step 3 Prepare the dough for the Samosa
Now to prepare the dough, take a mixing bowl and combine all-purpose flour along with carom,
seeds and salt.
Mix and then add ghee and start kneading by adding a little water at a time.
Ensure that you add water gradually and make a firm dough. A soft dough will not make your,
samosas crispy. Cover the dough with a damp muslin cloth and keep aside for about half an hour


Step 4 Roll the dough in small puris and cut into half

Once done, roll out few small-sized balls from the dough.
Flatten them further with the help of your palms and then with a rolling pin.
Give them a round shape and cut in half. 
Now dip your hands in water, fold the edges of the semi-circle in order to give it a cone shape.

Step 5 Fill the semi-circle with potato filling and deep fry
Take the filling with the help of a spoon and stuff it in the cone.
Seal the ends properly by pressing the edges lightly with your fingers. 
Then, heat oil in a pan and deep fry the samosas on,
low heat until they turn golden brown and crispy.
Serve with tomato ketchup and green chutney.
